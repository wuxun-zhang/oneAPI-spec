DPC++
=====

Overview
--------

|dpcpp_full_name| (DPC++) is the direct programming language and
associated direct programming APIs of oneAPI.  It provides the
features needed to define data parallel functions and to launch them
on devices.  The language is comprised of the following components:

- C++.  Every DPC++ program is also a C++ program.  A
  compliant DPC++ implementation must support the C++17 Core Language
  (as specified in Sections 1-19 of ISO/IEC 14882:2017) or
  newer.  See the `C++ Standard`_.

- SYCL.  DPC++ builds on the SYCL specification from The Khronos Group.
  The SYCL language enables
  the definition of data parallel functions that can be offloaded to
  devices and defines runtime APIs and classes that are used to
  orchestrate the offloaded functions.

- DPC++ Language extensions. A compliant DPC++ implementation must
  support the specified language features.  Some
  extensions are required only when the DPC++
  implementation supports a specific class of device, as summarized in the
  `Extensions Table`_. An implementation supports a class of device if
  it can target hardware that responds “true” for a DPC++
  device type query, either through explicit support built into the
  implementation, or by using a lower layer that can support those
  device classes such as the oneAPI Level Zero 
  (Level Zero).  A DPC++ implementation must pass the 
  conformance tests for all extensions that are required (`Extensions
  Table`_) for the classes of devices that the implementation can
  support.  (See `SYCL Extensions`_.)

This specification requires a minimum of C++17 Core Language support and
DPC++ extensions. These version and feature coverage requirements
will evolve over time, with specific versions of C++ and SYCL being required,
some additional extensions being required, and some DPC++ extensions no longer
required if covered by newer C++ or SYCL versions directly.

Detailed API and Language Descriptions
--------------------------------------

The `SYCL 2020 Specification`_ describes the SYCL APIs and language.  DPC++ extensions on top of SYCL
are described in the `SYCL Extensions`_ repository.

A brief summary of the extensions is as follows:

-  Accessor properties - compile-time accessor properties that are visible to the compiler.
-  CXX standard library - enable subset of the C and C++ standard libraries in device code.
-  Data flow pipes - enable efficient First-In, First-Out (FIFO) communication in DPC++, a mechanism commonly
   used when describing algorithms for spatial architectures such as FPGAs. 
-  Enqueued barriers - simplifies dependence creation and tracking for some common programming patterns by allowing
   coarser grained synchronization within a queue without manual creation of fine grained dependencies.
-  Extended atomics - adds *atomic_accessor* on top of SYCL 2020 atomics.
-  Filter selector - adds a device selector which consumes a string of filter definitions, and that can be used to
   easily restrict the set of devices which are passed to the usual device selection mechanisms.
-  FPGA LSU controls - tuning controls for FPGA load/store operations.
-  FPGA memory channel - placement controls for data with external memory banks (e.g. DDR channel) for tuning
   FPGA designs.
-  FPGA register - tuning control for FPGA high performance pipelining.
-  FPGA selector - adds a set of device selectors that make it easy to acquire an FPGA hardware or emulation device.
-  GPU device info - adds GPU-specific queries around SIMD width, memory bandwidth, unique identifiers, and
   topology of the compute structures.
-  Level zero backend - defines interoperability with Level Zero as a backend to SYCL.
-  Local memory allocations - adds ability for local memory allocations to be declared within a kernel, as opposed
   to through an accessor that is passed to a kernel.  Makes kernels more self contained and easier to read and optimize.
-  Pinned memory property - optimization indicating that a buffer should use a specific memory resource if possible,
   to accelerate movement of data between host and devices in some implementations.
-  Platform context - adds a default context per SYCL platform, which simplifies and improves performance in common
   coding patterns.
-  Restrict all arguments - defines an attribute that can be applied to kernels (including lambda definitions of kernels)
   which signals that there will be no memory aliasing between any pointer arguments that are passed to or captured
   by a kernel.  This is an optimization attribute that can have large impact when the developer knows more about the
   kernel arguments than a compiler can infer or safely assume.
-  Sub-group mask - adds a new opaque type and operations on it, which can be used to represent and manage sets of
   work-items within a sub-group.

Open Source Implementation
--------------------------

An `open source implementation`_ is available under
an LLVM license.  Details on incomplete features and known issues are
available in the `Release Notes`_ (and the `Getting Started Guide`_
until the release notes are available).

Testing
-------

A DPC++ implementation must pass the `extension tests`_ for any
extension implemented from the `Extensions Table`_.  Each extension in
the `Extensions Table`_ lists the name of the directory that contains
corresponding tests, within the `extension tests`_ tree.
